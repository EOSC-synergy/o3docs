O3as: Ozone assessment service's documentation
==========================================================
O3as is a service within the framework of the European Open Science Cloud - Synergy (`EOSC-Synergy <https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/>`_) project, 
mainly for scientists working on the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (`CCMI <http://blogs.reading.ac.uk/ccmi/ccmi-phase-two/>`_) 
for the quadrennial global `assessment of ozone depletion <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csl/assessments/ozone/2018/>`_ due in 2022. 
 
The O3as service shall provide an invaluable tool to extract ozone trends from large climate prediction model data to produce 
figures of stratospheric ozone trends in publication quality, in a coherent way.
