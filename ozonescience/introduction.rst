Ozone introduction
===================

This introduces you to ozone science: why ozone is important for
our everyday life, what is ozone assessment. We present then our O3as
service, how it can be used for simple analysis and a more advanced one.
In the advanced section we show the underlying software technologies we
are using.


Role of ozone for our life
---------------------------

Ozone is a trace gas in the Earth’s atmosphere, that means that it only
occurs in very small quantities on Earth. Trace gases are gases that are
not nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%) or argon (0.934%), i.e. they make
up only about 0.066% of the atmosphere (not including water which makes
up about 4%. If all the ozone were compressed to the pressure at the
Earth's surface (at 1013 hPa and 0°C) then the atmospheric content of
ozone would make up a layer of 3 mm (which is equivalent to 300 Dobson
Units (DU)) . The highest content of ozone is found in the stratosphere
at a height of about 25 to 30 km where the concentrations are about 10
parts per million parts of air (ppm), i.e. 0.001%.

The ozone present in the stratosphere at about 25 to 30 km is what makes
up most ozone in the atmosphere. This ozone is important for life on
planet Earth because it is responsible for removing most of the harmful
ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The longwave UV-A radiation
(about 315–400 nm) is not absorbed, medium range UV-B radiation (about
280–315 nm) is mostly absorbed and the most dangerous shortwave UV-C
radiation (about 100–280 nm) is totally absorbed by the ozone layer. A
decrease in the ozone layer increases the amount of UV-B radiation
reaching the Earth’s surface and the risk of skin cancer. Since UV
radiation not only has an effect of the health of human beings it also
has an effect on vegetation it is important to monitor stratospheric
ozone.

Ozone hole and ozone assessment
-------------------------------

With support of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), NASA, NOAA, and the European
Commission periodic `assessments of the state of
ozone <https://csl.noaa.gov/assessments/ozone/>`__ in the stratosphere
are produced. Monitoring and the assessment of stratospheric ozone was
started after the discovery of the ozone hole in the early eighties.
Realizing that the decline of stratospheric ozone was due to harmful
ozone destroying substances (ODSs) consisting of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) the Montreal protocol (1987)
and successor protocols were established to gradually curb the
production of ODSs. The first assessment of the state of ozone was
published in 1985, since 1994 they appear quadrennially.
