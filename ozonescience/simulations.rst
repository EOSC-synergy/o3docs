Ozone simulations and observations (e.g. CCMI, SBUV etc)
===========================================================

There is a huge effort to predict the future development of
stratospheric ozone under different scenarios. These scenarios are
modelled in different groups with different model setups/different
boundary/initial conditions. In order to get a robust prediction many
different model runs can be combined into ensembles. Model runs of total
ozone often donâ€™t have same absolute values and are therefore normalized
using satellite observations of ozone data. A date can then be picked at
which the ozone of all the models agrees with the measured ozone. Only
then they can be compared. For a more robust prediction of the behaviour
of future ozone an average of all the model realizations can be produced
to make a multi model mean so that a more robust prediction can be made.
